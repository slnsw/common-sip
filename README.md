# drf-common-sip
This repository contains the [DRF Common SIP specification](specification.md) which was developed as part of the Cluster DRF project, funded by the NSW Government [Digital Restart Fund](https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/funding/digital-restart-fund). The Cluster DRF project is a collobarative project which includes the [State Library of NSW](https://www.sl.nsw.gov.au), [Australian Museum](https://australian.museum), [Sydney Opera House](https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/) and [Art Gallery of New South Wales](https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/).

The purpose of this is to provide a system agnostic Digital Preservation Submission Information Package(SIP) specification which meets the requirements of all four Cultural Institutions (CIs) in the DRF project. This specification has been made public as of version 0.5 under the [MIT license](LICENSE).

A [supplementary document](supplement.md) is also provided which includes some background information and rationale behind decisions made in the specification. This is necessary to keep the main specification document succinct.

For any queries please contact the [State Library of NSW](https://www.sl.nsw.gov.au).
